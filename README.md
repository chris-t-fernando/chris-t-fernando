I'm Chris.  This repo contains code that I've used to develop skills and experience.

A lot of it is quick and dirty, intended to get some real-world experience.  The larger projects could be described as Rube Goldberg-type machines - done so that my small projects might ape larger execution architectures in some way (eg using AWS SQS for interprocess communication when the processes are executing on the same host, using AWS EventBridge for a flow that could easily be scripted, etc).

I come from a deep infrastructure background, so I come at my projects with that mindset and interest (infra automation, infrastructure-as-code, etc) but I also do this to develop skills further 'up the stack' on the AWS and Azure clouds, and DevOps (CICD tooling, Blue/Green deployment approaches, SCM etc).
